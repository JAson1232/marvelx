    "description": "I am writing to request reimbursement for a prepaid medical appointment that I was unable to attend due to international travel on March 5, 2024.\n\nI had a confirmed appointment scheduled in Johannesburg that morning, but my flight from Windhoek with South African Airways (SA 1732) did not land in time for me to reach the clinic. As a result, I missed the appointment entirely and was still charged $113 in advance as per the clinic's cancellation policy.\n\nAttached is a copy of my boarding pass confirming my travel on the morning of March 5. I kindly ask for compensation for the lost appointment.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nDerek Kotze\n",
