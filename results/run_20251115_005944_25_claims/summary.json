My partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since the night of July 22 after we rushed to the ER at Cl\u00ednica Reina Sof\u00eda. He was moved to a hospital room the next morning and is still admitted.\n\nWe were supposed to fly to Miami together on the 15th, but there's no way he'll be discharged or fit to travel by then. I\u2019ve attached the certificate from the clinic that confirms everything.\n\nI wanted to let you know ahead of time since we already know we won\u2019t be able to make the trip. Hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency policy for cancellation.\n\nThanks for understanding,  \nMarta Rojas Valbuena\n",

The claimant's name, Daisy Mariuxi Bastidas Angulo, matches the name on the medical certificate. The flight was scheduled for 29 July 2023, the same day as the surgery, which justifies the cancellation. The medical certificate has a visible signature and official stamp. The timeline is reasonable, as the surgery occurred on the same day as the flight. The current date is 2023-08-13, and the surgery date was 2023-07-29, so the claim is not for a future event.

The check-up was mandated to assess her physical fitness and included detailed measurements, visual acuity tests, and other clinical evaluations.\n\nAlthough she was declared clinically healthy, the unforeseen scheduling and duration of this mandatory appointment made it impossible for us to arrive at the airport on time.\n\nI respectfully request a refund for the missed flight and attach the official medical certificate issued by Dr. Franco R.

Malheureusement, en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical soudain, elle n'a pas pu prendre part aux activit\u00e9s.\n\nNous avions pay\u00e9 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du montant de 450 \u20ac \u00e0 l'avance pour un stage incluant des cours de cano\u00eb-kayak. Cependant, le 5 septembre 2018, le Dr Sylvie a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 un certificat m\u00e9dical indiquant que Lily FANG ne pouvait pas pratiquer d'activit\u00e9s physiques, y compris le cano\u00eb en comp\u00e9tition, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 (\"cause \u00e0 pied\").\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence, Lily Fang a manqu\u00e9 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du stage et n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun remboursement de l'organisateur malgr\u00e9 nos d\u00e9marches.\n\nJe joins \u00e0 cette r\u00e9clamation le certificat m\u00e9dical du Dr Sylvie comme preuve de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer.\n\nJe sollicite donc le remboursement pr\u00e9vu dans ma police d'assurance au titre des \"activit\u00e9s manqu\u00e9es pour cause de maladie\".\n\nMerci de prendre en compte ma demande.\n\nCordialement,\nCamille Martin",

I had been experiencing symptoms for several days, but on the morning of the trip, I felt too unwell to travel and made the difficult decision to stay home.\n\nThe medical certificate issued by Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirms my condition and the consultation on February 5, 2017. I understand the appointment was not on the same day as the scheduled trip, but I hope you will consider the documentation as valid support for my request. The illness clearly impacted my ability to travel.\n",
