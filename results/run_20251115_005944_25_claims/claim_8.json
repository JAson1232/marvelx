    "explanation": "The medical documentation is provided as a .md (markdown) file, which is not an acceptable format. Medical certificates MUST be image files of official documents. This is a Priority 1 fraud indicator. Additionally, the current date is 2024-12-14 and the discharge date is 2024-12-14. The flight was scheduled for 2024-12-14. The discharge summary states that travel is advised against for 48 hours. Since the flight was scheduled for the same day as the discharge, and travel was advised against, the claim would be valid if the documentation was in the correct format. However, due to the unacceptable file format, the claim must be denied.",
