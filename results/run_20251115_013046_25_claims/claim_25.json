The supporting document 'booking confirmation 1.jpg' shows a transaction record from Booking.com on July 12, 2024, for \u20ac1594.44. The current date is August 15, 2024. The claim mentions an attached dental certificate, but it was not provided in the supporting documents. Without the dental certificate, it's impossible to verify the medical emergency and its impact on the trip. Therefore, the claim is marked as UNCERTAIN, pending the submission of the dental certificate.",
