        "description": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am filing a claim for reimbursement of my flight, which I was unable to take due to a sudden medical emergency that required hospitalization and surgery.\n\nOn August 13, 2011, I was admitted to Clinique M\u00e9dicale de Bassam for acute pelvic pain, cardiac distress, and gallbladder complications. The attending physician, Dr. Kouassi Kone Francois, diagnosed me with biliary colic and cholelithiasis and ordered an urgent surgical intervention. Due to this, I could not proceed with my scheduled travel.\n\nPlease find attached the official hospitalization certificate as proof of my condition. I request a refund of the flight.\n\nSincerely,  \nEvelyne Kacou Meitiale",

My partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since the night of July 22 after we rushed to the ER at Cl\u00ednica Reina Sof\u00eda. He was moved to a hospital room the next morning and is still admitted.\n\nWe were supposed to fly to Miami together on the 15th, but there's no way he'll be discharged or fit to travel by then. I\u2019ve attached the certificate from the clinic that confirms everything.\n\nI wanted to let you know ahead of time since we already know we won\u2019t be able to make the trip. Hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency policy for cancellation.\n\nThanks for understanding,  \nMarta Rojas Valbuena\n",

The check-up was mandated to assess her physical fitness and included detailed measurements, visual acuity tests, and other clinical evaluations.\n\nAlthough she was declared clinically healthy, the unforeseen scheduling and duration of this mandatory appointment made it impossible for us to arrive at the airport on time.\n\nI respectfully request a refund for the missed flight and attach the official medical certificate issued by Dr. Franco R.

        "description": "Bonjour,\n\nJe souhaite soumettre une demande de remboursement concernant un stage sportif auquel ma fille, Lily Fang, devait participer en septembre 2018. Malheureusement, en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical soudain, elle n'a pas pu prendre part aux activit\u00e9s.\n\nNous avions pay\u00e9 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du montant de 450 \u20ac \u00e0 l'avance pour un stage incluant des cours de cano\u00eb-kayak. Cependant, le 5 septembre 2018, le Dr Sylvie a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 un certificat m\u00e9dical indiquant que Lily FANG ne pouvait pas pratiquer d'activit\u00e9s physiques, y compris le cano\u00eb en comp\u00e9tition, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 (\"cause \u00e0 pied\").\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence, Lily Fang a manqu\u00e9 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du stage et n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun remboursement de l'organisateur malgr\u00e9 nos d\u00e9marches.\n\nJe joins \u00e0 cette r\u00e9clamation le certificat m\u00e9dical du Dr Sylvie comme preuve de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer.\n\nJe sollicite donc le remboursement pr\u00e9vu dans ma police d'assurance au titre des \"activit\u00e9s manqu\u00e9es pour cause de maladie\".\n\nMerci de prendre en compte ma demande.\n\nCordialement,\nCamille Martin",

The patient name on the medical certificate is 'R , G', and the train data shows the claimant's name as Roy Hoffman. Given the medical procedure on the same day as the train departure, it is reasonable to assume that 'R , G' refers to Roy Hoffman. The medical certificate indicates a diagnosis of Urothelcarcinom (bladder cancer), which is a serious condition that would prevent travel. The train data confirms the booking details. The current date is 2007-08-08, and the travel date was 2007-06-27, so the travel date is in the past. The policy covers trip cancellation for medical emergencies with valid documentation.",

A medical certificate from Hospital Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas in Quevedo, Ecuador, is provided, stating the daughter was treated for a severe headache and advised to rest for 24 hours. The certificate is dated January 5, 2016. The medical certificate has a stamp and letterhead, but it lacks a visible signature from a medical professional. The patient's name on the certificate, PILLASAGUA CANO AMARILIS ESTELA, is different from the claimant's name, Esteban Pillasagua. However, since the claim is made on behalf of the daughter, this is acceptable. The absence of a signature is a concern, but the presence of a stamp and letterhead suggests the document might be legitimate. Therefore, I mark this claim as UNCERTAIN.",

I had been experiencing symptoms for several days, but on the morning of the trip, I felt too unwell to travel and made the difficult decision to stay home.\n\nThe medical certificate issued by Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirms my condition and the consultation on February 5, 2017. I understand the appointment was not on the same day as the scheduled trip, but I hope you will consider the documentation as valid support for my request. The illness clearly impacted my ability to travel.\n",
