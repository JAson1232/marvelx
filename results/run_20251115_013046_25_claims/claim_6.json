    "description": "Hi,\n\nI'm reaching out early to cancel our upcoming flight for August 15. My partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since the night of July 22 after we rushed to the ER at Cl\u00ednica Reina Sof\u00eda. He was moved to a hospital room the next morning and is still admitted.\n\nWe were supposed to fly to Miami together on the 15th, but there's no way he'll be discharged or fit to travel by then. I\u2019ve attached the certificate from the clinic that confirms everything.\n\nI wanted to let you know ahead of time since we already know we won\u2019t be able to make the trip. Hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency policy for cancellation.\n\nThanks for understanding,  \nMarta Rojas Valbuena\n",
