    "description": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am requesting reimbursement for a flight I was unable to take due to a sudden illness in December. I had planned to travel for the holidays but became unwell just days before my departure.\n\nOn December 21st, 2022, I was examined by a doctor in Brussels and was declared unfit to work from December 22 through December 24 due to illness. A medical certificate was issued at the time (attached). Although the illness was not prolonged, I was advised to rest and avoid travel until fully recovered.\n\nAs a result, I had to cancel my flight originally scheduled for December 23, 2022. Please find my booking and medical certificate enclosed.\n\nI hope this qualifies under the CFSR policy.\n\nThank you for your help,  \nLouis Ndembele",
