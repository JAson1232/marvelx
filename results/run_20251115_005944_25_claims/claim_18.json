The image file 'hospital admission document.png' appears to be a photograph of a person in front of a building with the word 'HOSPITAL' on it, but it is not an official hospital admission document. It lacks key elements such as a patient name, dates of admission/discharge, diagnosis, signature of a medical professional, and an official hospital stamp or letterhead. The OCR extraction also failed to extract any meaningful text. The claim states the claimant was admitted to [HOSPITAL_NAME] in [CITY], but this information is not verifiable from the provided image. Without a valid medical certificate, the claim cannot be approved.",
