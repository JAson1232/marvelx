    "description": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to request a refund for a flight I was unable to take on **February 27, 2020**, due to a serious accident that required urgent medical attention.\n\nOn that day, I was treated at the Emiro Quintero Ca\u00f1izares Hospital in Oca\u00f1a after sustaining multiple injuries, including facial trauma, nasal fractures, and an oblique fracture in the upper arm. The attending physician recommended immediate rest and recovery.\n\nI was given a signed and sealed document issued by Dr. Jorge Andrez Arias Castro, which confirms the diagnosis and circumstances of my hospitalization. I can provide this document upon request.\n\nDue to this unexpected and incapacitating medical emergency, I was unable to attend my scheduled flight. I kindly ask that you take this situation into consideration and approve a refund for the unused ticket.\n\nThank you very much for your understanding.\n",

    "decision": "DENY",
    "explanation": "The claim is denied because the supporting medical documentation is described as a signed and sealed document from Dr. Jorge Andrez Arias Castro, but it was not provided as an image file. Instead, the claim description states that it can be provided 'upon request'. According to the policy, medical certificates MUST be IMAGE FILES (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, etc.) and must be official documents, not text-based descriptions. Since no image of the medical certificate was provided, the claim is automatically denied.",
