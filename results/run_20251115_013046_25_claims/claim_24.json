    "description": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to request a refund for a train journey I was unable to take on February 2, 2017, due to a medical issue that worsened the day before travel.\n\nWhile I did not seek medical attention immediately, the following day I visited the Hospital General Docente Calder\u00f3n in Quito and was diagnosed with sinusitis (ICD-10: J66). I had been experiencing symptoms for several days, but on the morning of the trip, I felt too unwell to travel and made the difficult decision to stay home.\n\nThe medical certificate issued by Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirms my condition and the consultation on February 5, 2017. I understand the appointment was not on the same day as the scheduled trip, but I hope you will consider the documentation as valid support for my request. The illness clearly impacted my ability to travel.\n",

ELIZABETH CUEVA' is typed, but there is no physical signature present on the document. Additionally, the claim is for a train journey on February 2, 2017, but the medical certificate is dated February 5, 2017, indicating the claimant did not seek medical attention until after the scheduled travel. While the certificate states the claimant was diagnosed with sinusitis (ICD-10: J66), the absence of a signature and the delayed medical consultation raise concerns about the validity of the claim. The claimant states they felt unwell on the day of travel, but the medical certificate was issued three days later. The absence of a signature is a critical issue. The metadata also confirms that there is no signature.",
