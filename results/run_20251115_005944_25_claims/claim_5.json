    "description": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m writing to explain why I had to cancel my flight on such short notice.\n\nOn October 31st, I suddenly felt really shitty while at work at the retirement home (Casa di Riposo Sant\u2019Anna). I left around 12:30 PM and was checked out by the doctor on site, Dr. Lucini Cristina. She confirmed I wasn\u2019t in a condition to keep working or travel and told me to follow up with my own doctor. I've attached her note here.\n\nUnfortunately, my flight to Palermo was scheduled for the next morning, and I just wasn\u2019t physically up for it. I had to cancel the whole trip. I\u2019m hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency clause of my travel insurance.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,  \nOlivier Bayante\n",
