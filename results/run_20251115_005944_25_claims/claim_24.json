    "description": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to request a refund for a train journey I was unable to take on February 2, 2017, due to a medical issue that worsened the day before travel.\n\nWhile I did not seek medical attention immediately, the following day I visited the Hospital General Docente Calder\u00f3n in Quito and was diagnosed with sinusitis (ICD-10: J66). I had been experiencing symptoms for several days, but on the morning of the trip, I felt too unwell to travel and made the difficult decision to stay home.\n\nThe medical certificate issued by Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirms my condition and the consultation on February 5, 2017. I understand the appointment was not on the same day as the scheduled trip, but I hope you will consider the documentation as valid support for my request. The illness clearly impacted my ability to travel.\n",
