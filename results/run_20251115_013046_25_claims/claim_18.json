    "explanation": "The provided medical documentation (hospital admission document.png) lacks critical elements for validation. The document metadata indicates the absence of a signature, official stamp, and letterhead. Furthermore, the OCR extraction failed, meaning no text could be extracted from the image. The image itself appears to be a photograph of a person in front of a building labeled \"HOSPITAL\", not an official medical document. This falls under Priority 1 fraud indicators: missing signature, and lack of official document format. The document is essentially an image with the word \"HOSPITAL\" on it, not an official medical certificate. The claim is therefore denied due to incomplete and insufficient documentation.",
